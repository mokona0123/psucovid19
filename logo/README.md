# Nextstrain logos

![Nextstrain](logo.svg)

These vector logos were made in Inkscape from existing assets in use by Auspice and nextstrain.org.

The [circular tree](circular-tree.svg) was traced from [this bitmap](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/blob/71efbae68510b3c04c354a58339fe54d12f6c84c/docs/img/nextstrain.png) used in Auspice's documentation.
The resulting path was broken apart into the individual polygons and colored.
The original [trace](trace.svg) document has two stacked layers: one containing the bitmap and the other containing the trace.
This is handy for comparing the fidelity of the two by toggling layer visibility.

The [wordmark](wordmark.svg) was reproduced based on the font, weight, and colors used in the [nextstrain.org splash title](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/blob/1ecd072d2f8661d8cb82e252f43ffba3ac260b2d/static-site/src/components/splash/title.jsx).

The [portable wordmark](wordmark-portable.svg) and [portable logo](logo-portable.svg) have converted the text to paths so that the Lato font is not required for correct display.
