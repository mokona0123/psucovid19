# This YAML file defines external links which we wish to display
# in the sidebar of the gtasby docs, help etc.
# The rendering component is at src/components/Sidebar/index.jsx.
# Note: this data could be injected in the graphQL data but it was easier
# (for me) to do it on the react side as that's where i'm more
# comfortable.

# After migrating all docs to docs.nextstrain.org, we no longer use this.

# Here is what it would look like if you wanted to add an external link sidebar entry using this file:
# - section: "docs"
#   chapter: "getting-started"
#   name: "Container Installation"
#   url: "https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/cli/en/latest/installation/"
